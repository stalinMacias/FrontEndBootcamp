            What is The Viewport?
        The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.
        
    A <meta> viewport element gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

    The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

    The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.

        Some additional rules to follow:
    _________________________________________

1. Do NOT use large fixed width elements - For example, if an image is displayed at a width wider than the viewport it can cause the viewport to scroll horizontally. Remember to adjust this content to fit within the width of the viewport.9

2. Do NOT let the content rely on a particular viewport width to render well - Since screen dimensions and width in CSS pixels vary widely between devices, content should not rely on a particular viewport width to render well.

3. Use CSS media queries to apply different styling for small and large screens - Setting large absolute CSS widths for page elements will cause the element to be too wide for the viewport on a smaller device. Instead, consider using relative width values, such as width: 100%. Also, be careful of using large absolute positioning values. It may cause the element to fall outside the viewport on small devices.
