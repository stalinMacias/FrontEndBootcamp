            <p>If you are struggling yourself in your own transformation, I want to tell you that you have to keep doing it, dont quit, is 100 times better think, I tried and I dit my best, instead of have that feeling of want to know what could you have achieved if you would never quit</p>

            <h3 class="title-messages-for-usser">I would like to know this when I start my journey</h3>
            <p>It is said that feeding is a 70% of your progress, and it is totally true. <br> But also it is true that you dont need to follow a strict diet where you cant eat your favorite meals by a long time. <br> You can achieve your fitness goals without stop eating what you love. <br>The secret is called "IIYM", it means: "If It Fits Your Macros". <br>Probably you have never listened about it before, but dont worry, I have a section in this website where I talk deeper about this topic!</p>
